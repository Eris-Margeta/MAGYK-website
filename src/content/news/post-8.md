#### Network Optimization

At Magyk Eclipse 2026 in London, we hit a milestone: 10 million tokens burned, as part of our whitepaper’s 2% burn mechanism, enhancing network efficiency.

#### Community Impact

The burn reduces clutter, benefiting token holders. Participants in the burn ritual received “Eclipse Seer” NFTs as rewards.

#### What’s Next

More burns are planned for 2027 events. Stay updated on X for the latest tokenomics news.
